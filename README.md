# MAPChatbot (Vue 3, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Python, Flask)

During my two-month tenure at the Department of Information Systems (DSI) of Maghreb Arab Press (MAP), I spearheaded a project to optimize GPT-3.5 using specific organization-related data sourced from online platforms and annual reports. 

The goal was to develop an AI-powered chatbot aimed at enhancing user experience by providing immediate access to pertinent information, thus bypassing complex platform navigation. The chatbot, integrated seamlessly within MAP's existing interface, ensures intuitive and user-friendly interaction.
